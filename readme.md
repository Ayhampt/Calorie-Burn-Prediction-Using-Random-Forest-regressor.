# Calorie Burn Prediction — Medical-Grade Analytics

**Medical-grade web UI to estimate calories burned during exercise, using a trained Random Forest regressor.**  
Includes an interactive Streamlit app for patient/workout inputs, intensity zone reporting, and transparent performance metrics.

## 🚀 Overview

- **Interactive web app:** Estimate calories burned with customizable demographic and exercise inputs via Streamlit.
- **Intensity analysis:** Calculates intensity zone based on heart rate zones and maximum HR.
- **Medical metrics:** Reports calories per minute and BMI alongside predictions.
- **Educational use:** Research-focused; not for direct clinical deployment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `app.py` — Main Streamlit application (UI, input handling, prediction logic, metrics display)
- `Calorie Burn Prediction-IDS Project.ipynb` — Full EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and artifact saving
- `calories.csv`, `exercise.csv` — Datasets with demographic and physiological exercise variables
- `calories_model.pkl`, `metrics.pkl` — Saved model and evaluation metrics (regenerated by notebook)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Clone this repo and navigate into it.

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

4. Open the app in your browser at the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

## 🧑‍⚕️ Usage

- Use the UI to input: **Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, Body Temp**
- Click **"🔬 ANALYZE WORKOUT"** to predict:
- Calories burned (primary output)
- Calories per minute, BMI
- Intensity zone and maximum heart rate (calculated with formulas)
- Data is processed, encoded, and passed to the random forest model for prediction.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training & Reproducibility

Full preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipeline is in  
`Calorie Burn Prediction-IDS Project.ipynb`:
- **Missing value handling** (SimpleImputer)
- **Feature encoding** (e.g., Gender → numeric)
- **Random Forest**: 80-20 train/test, MAE/R² reporting
- **Artifacts:** Saves `calories_model.pkl`, `metrics.pkl` (must be in repo root for live predictions)

*To retrain with new data:*
- Edit & run the notebook.
- Ensure saved model/metrics (`calories_model.pkl`, `metrics.pkl`) are in the root directory.

## 📝 Data Schema

- Source CSVs: `exercise.csv`, `calories.csv`
- Features: Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, Body_Temp
- Target: Calories burned

## 🛠️ API & Helpers (Quick Reference)

- `load_model`: Loads model and metrics artifacts (cache optimized)
- `calculate_max_heart_rate`: Computes max HR (\( \text{MHR} = 220 - \text{age} \))
- `get_intensity_zone`: Maps %HRmax to intensity zone
